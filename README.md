LiFi(Light fidelity) is a new technology for wireless communication which uses light to to transmit data between two devices.In terms of technology is similar to Wifi.The main difference between Lifi and Wifi is that wifi uses radio frequency to transmit data whereas lifi uses light to transmit data.My project deals with a simple prototype which consists of a lifi transmitter and a receiver which can be built with less than 10$(usd).several advantages like working across higher bandwidth[citation needed], working in areas susceptible to electromagnetic interference (e.g. aircraft cabins, hospitals) and offering higher transmission speeds. The technology is actively being developed by several organizations across the globe.
